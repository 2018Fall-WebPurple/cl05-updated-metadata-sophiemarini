            <p> You may think having a pig as a pet seems completly crazy, but theyre actually easier than you think! </p>
            <p> To take care of a pig is not much harder than a dog. You may need to pottytrain, keep occupied, and keep hygene up to date, however this is nothing you cant handle. Theyre also not as dirty and filthy as they are advertised to be in fact they are quite clean and organized. Often they will potty train themselves and form a daily schedule to follow. Eat, sleep, play and repeat. </p>

            <p> Domesticated animals dont argue cause a conflict between relationships. They are a perfect friend to have by your side because they do not fail to entertain people whether we feel angry, sad, or happy. They will always be there to support you through all you do and constantly give as much joy to you as needed.</p>
            <p> Although pigs as pets offer nothing but pure joy and happiness, they can also offer many therapeutic benefits. People with pets are less likeyly to suffer from depression and have less stress surrounding them. They are also proven to physically improve your health. Many people say they are less likely to suffer from high blood pressure, heart attacks, and muscle tension. You may not know it, but it seems to be proven that everyone deserves a pig! </p>
